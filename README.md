Machine Learning Approach in OCR-Based Case Computation Project
Introduction
In this project, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) was utilized to extract text from scanned photographs, followed by case-based computation using a machine learning (ML) approach. 	This document outlines the machine learning models used, experiments conducted, and conclusions drawn.

1. Machine Learning Approach
The project primarily revolved around three key steps: data extraction using OCR, parameter-based computation, and result extraction through regex. Here’s how machine learning contributed to the pipeline:
•	OCR Data Extraction: Tesseract OCR was used to extract text data from images. Since OCR outputs are often imperfect, ML techniques were applied for noise reduction and improving text clarity.
•	Parameter Mapping: A case-based reasoning (CBR) approach was employed, where the extracted parameters were mapped to predefined cases or categories. These categories were then used to compute the final result based on predefined rules.
•	Regex-Based Result Extraction: Once the relevant data was identified and structured, regular expressions were employed to extract specific values or results.
2. Preprocessing Steps
Preprocessing included the following:
•	Noise Removal: Basic text cleaning methods, such as removing unwanted characters or fixing common OCR misreads (like "0" instead of "O"), were implemented.
•	Stopword Removal: Non-informative words (such as “a,” “the,” etc.) were eliminated to ensure focus on relevant information.
•	Case Mapping: A dictionary-based mapping system was designed to handle long-form cases. The data was matched to the appropriate case for computation.

3. Models Used
Tesseract OCR: Although not a model in the traditional ML sense, Tesseract's performance was optimized by experimenting with various image pre-processing techniques to enhance text recognition.
These models were evaluated and fine-tuned to ensure that the right cases were identified for computation.

4. Experiments Conducted
Several experiments were conducted to fine-tune both the OCR system and the classification models used in parameter identification.
•	OCR Accuracy Tuning: By adjusting image quality (using binarization, scaling, and sharpening), the OCR engine's text extraction, didn’t show any such enhancement in accuracy
•	Regex Flexibility: Experiments were conducted to find patterns that would extract the required data with minimal errors. Different regex patterns were designed and tested on a variety of texts, ensuring high precision in the output extraction.

5. Conclusion
This project demonstrated the effective integration of OCR technology with machine learning models to perform case-based computations. The use of regex added flexibility in extracting precise answers from large text data
